## The Challenge

### Briefing

- [Frontend Mentor Basis](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw)

- Your challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- While you’re doing that we’ll create new `branches` for each new piece of your website, then send it to GitHub when the code is done, and open **Code Review.** The goal is to get used to the development cycle.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- [ ] Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - [ ] Any input field is empty
  - [ ] The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- [ ] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
